1. Before I had experience with program based languages like Java, C, and MATLAB. Now i also have experience with web-base languages, such as Javascript, HTML, CSS.

2. The final project. I set my goal way to high and didnt have the skills to do it myself. I had to admit I was over my head and ask for help tgo be able to get my project done in time.

3. Yes. I can not learn from lectures, I need to be doing something.

4. I'll make sure never to miss an interactive lecture.

5. Overall okay. It really works best when you are partnered with someone on the same level as you. If you are paired with someone who might be lacking a little you get dragged down having to help them.
